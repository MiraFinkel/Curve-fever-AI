Final project in introduction to artificial inteligernce course at Hebrew university in Jerusalem.

Description
-----------

In this project, we designed smart agents who can play Curve Fever (Achtung Die!) at a human level. 

- **Min-Max agent:**

    Preforms a search of the game tree using alpha-beta pruning. It uses a weighted sum of a few heuristis evaluate the nodes of the tree and chooses the best move in each timestep. 
    
- **Deep reinforcement learning Agent:**

    Extracts features from the game state at every time step and evalueates the feature vector using a trained neural net to choose an action.
